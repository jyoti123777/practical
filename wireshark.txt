To sniff communication between client and server 
Filter: ip.addr == 192.168.2.67 && ip.addr == 192.168.2.65
   tcp.streams equals 883
	

Code:
Server.py
import socket
# next create a socket object 
s = socket.socket()
print ('Socket successfully created')
 
# reserve a port on your computer in our
# case it is 9000 but it can be anything
port = 9000
# Next bind to the port
s.bind(('192.168.2.65', port))
print ('socket binded to %s' %(port))
# put the socket into listening mode
s.listen(5)
print ("socket is listening")
# a forever loop until we interrupt it or
# an error occurs
while True:
# Establish connection with client.
    c, addr = s.accept()
    print ('Got connection from', addr)
# send a thank you message to the client.
    c.sendall('Thank you for connecting'.encode())
# Close the connection with the client
    c.close()
 

Client.py
import socket
# Create a socket object
s = socket.socket()
# Define the port on which you want to connect
port = 9000
# connect to the server 
s.connect(('192.168.2.65', port))
# receive data from the server
print (s.recv(1024).decode())
# close the connection
s.close()
